# Diabetes-Prediction
<p>Diabetes prediction is done using Random Forest Classifier.</p>
<p>The data set used in this project is "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set"</p>
<p>output is obtained running "run D:\dia_code\diabetes.py" in terminal</p>

## Random Forest Classifier
<p>A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.</p>
